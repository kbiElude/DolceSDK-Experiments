# DolceSDK-Experiments

A sandbox for PSP Vita homebrew app development that I wrote while learning the ropes of the platform.
You can take any of the source code stored here and do anything you want with it.

To build & experiment with the projects, you're going to need:

* DolceSDK (https://github.com/DolceSDK)
* PS Vita, preferably FW 3.60. Jailbroken, of course.

All development's done with VS Code + WSL.
